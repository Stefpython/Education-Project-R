2 - Variables of interest




#1 - Naming conventions:
Example of variable name: 
  for each model specific result, add the model name at the end of the variable.  eg: mod_logit, mod_knn, mod_tree
  for the predictive power indicators too, add the model name  eg.cv_knn, cv_nb  
 
 
 
 

#2 - Variables of interest
We look at test errors
We face a classification problem:
  --> pull out Accuracy,
               Error rate
               Sensitivity
               Specificity
               Kappa
               for every model (Using both hold out sampling and cross validation)
