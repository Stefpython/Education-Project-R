#1 - Naming conventions:
Example of variable name: 
  for each model specific result, add the model name at the end of the variable.  eg: mod_logit, mod_knn, mod_tree
  for the predictive power indicators too, add the model name  eg.cv_knn, cv_nb  
 
#2 - Variables of interest
We look at test errors
We face a classification problem:
  --> pull out Accuracy,
               Error rate
               Sensitivity
               Specificity
               Kappa
               for every model (Using both hold out sampling and cross validation)
               
#3 - What to do with each model?
  Methods: 
    Holdout sampling
    10-fold CV
    5-fold CV
   LOOCV 
  For each of these, extract: 
    Accuracy, 
    Error rate
    Sensitivity, 
    Specifiticy,
    Kappa
  Store the variables into one variable (list) with the corresponding names
